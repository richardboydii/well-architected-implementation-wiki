# well-architected-implementation-wiki

## Introduction

The [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that can scale over time. This wiki maps the Best Practices across the five pillars and provides room to document _your best practices_. 

## How to Use this Wiki

Each question from each Pillar has its own page. On the page we list each of the best practices as a H2 element. Underneath the heading, document how you implement a best practice. Make sure to include not only the technology information but the people and processes that it takes to truly implement a best practice. Also document what the Workload is, who someone can reach out to to learn more, and how current the information is. Here's a template you can use.
